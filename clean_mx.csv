Y a pesar de que lidio con la soledad y el encierro normalmente, trabajo en casa y puedo pasar mucho tiempo sin salir, esta situación de encierro obligatorio y el no poder saber cuándo voy a salir, ver a mis amigos, viajar, es angustiante. En el caso de las preguntas sobre la acción del gobierno, quiero aclarar que por un lado tengo confianza en el personal sanitario y en los funcionarios de salud pero no en otros mandos, empezando por el presidente, que no solo niega la situación con sus acciones sino que provoca la actitud de no pasa nada y que la gente no se tome enserio las recomendaciones. Tampoco es claro que en la parte económica se tenga un plan. Tengo, por como ha actuado, desconfianza en la figura presidencial que incluso merma la confianza en otras autoridades sanitarias, no porque no sepan qué hacer sino porque no pueden actuar sin la aprobación del presidente.

Sin embargo hay otros que siguen tomando cerveza, hablando con el vecino, caminando de un lado a otro sin un propósito aparente, etc. Por eso no confío en que se logre parar el riesgo de contagio local. También creo que esta situación nos sirve para reparar en que la superviviencia de unos es una cuestión incluso clasista, de quien haya podido reunir ingreso. El aislamiento social es ahortia ya un privilegio social. Con independencia de las mentalidades de ""vivir al día"" para ""hacer dinero y gastar en cerveza o de compras en Palacio de Hierro"" (que las hay), hay sin embargo, personas que tienen que salir a vender tacos, a trabajar en la calle, ni modo...

Me preocupa mi familia, amigos y seres queridos que están lejos. Sigo con mi misma planificación de trabajo pero por medios digitales. Y algunos lo entienden como ""más tiempo libre en casita"". Y esto lo que hace es darme más trabajo adicional y no dejarme canalizar el estrés en otras actividades dentro de casa fuera del trabajo habitual. Y por suerte, hasta ahora se mantienen los pagos a estudiantes y a no ser que explote una crisis económica nacional, esperemos con el favor de Dios, que no se afecten mis ingresos. Porque hay mucha gente que no puede decir lo mismo, que no tienen el privilegio de poder quedarse en casa. Hay mucho que decir en este sentido, porque uno también es empático con el mundo que te rodea. Pero en lo personal: estrés (mucho), sin tiempo por el trabajo como estudiante (más estrés), y demasiada incertidumbre que no te deja pensar en qué será el día de mañana, pasado ni el mes que viene.

Sin embargo, en esta ocasión me sentí más estresada y ansiosa (yo sufro de ansiedad). Debido a que el simple hecho de saber que ahora no puedo salir a menos que sea necesario me tenía intranquila, afortunadamente pude controlarme. 
Antes de que se declara en fase 1 nuestro país yo estaba pensando en todas las personas que padecemos un trastorno mental e incluso considero que debido a esta emergencia sanitaria los trastornos mentales como el TOC, TAG, depresión y la ansiedad van aumentar increíblemente. Ya que muchas personas ante una situación como esta se encuentra observando, viviendo, sintiendo emociones que pueden resistir o no. Incluso el hecho de tener acceso a información de forma inmediata puede ser un peligro emocional para las masas ya que se nota el pánico digital.
Yo no soy psicóloga, soy politóloga en formación y actualmente estoy realizando mi tesina sobre la salud mental en México desde el enfoque de políticas públicas. Por lo que espero que está encuesta cumpla su objetivo y que se tome en cuenta. Sin duda, después de que pase esto tendremos que hablar de la salud mental de los ciudadanos y las ciudadanas. Si bien, la salud mental sigue siendo un tema visto como un asusto personal con esto creo firmemente que es hora de verla como un problema de salud pública y no como un problema del individuo.
